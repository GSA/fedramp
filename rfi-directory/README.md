## Information for Interested Agencies 

### We’re glad you’re interested in our project!

We intend this public GitHub repository to be the source of collaboraton among agencies and the FedRAMP PMO as we move forward in our planning and implementation activities. We will do our best to keep this repo updated as decisions are made or if we need to pivot in our plans as we learn. We also want to hear from the community if you have any comments or questions. We’ll do our best to respond to your questions as they arrive, but we also can’t guarantee we can answer every question.

1. Please directly respond to any or all of the below questions with information you feel as though your company has the best information to share.

2. Note, all responses will be considered public information, either those directly in github, or comments submitted via email will be publicly posted as well.

3. We encourage respondents to post comments as an issue, using the [issue template](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) in the [RFI Directory](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp/tree/master/rfi-directory). Alternatively, you can submit responses to [info@fedramp.gov](mailto:info@fedramp.gov) with the subject line: **"Response to Acquisitions RFI Provided by [COMPANY NAME]"**, however please note all submitted comments will be publicly posted. Also, please note you do not need to submit responses via both channels, and using github is the preferred method as it will will greatly reduce our processing burden.

### So, what does this mean to the agency community?
In our efforts to help agencies continue to adopt secure cloud technologies, the GSA Secure Cloud Portfolio has been working to identify barriers for agencies adopting cloud services and in meeting FedRAMP requirements.

Over the past decade, Federal policy has consistently pushed forward a “Cloud First” mandate for agencies to default to purchasing cloud products and services for all new IT acquisitions. Additionally, agencies are required to ensure cloud providers meet the FedRAMP requirements when procuring and subsequently authorizing cloud services[^1]. We would like to help agencies acquire cloud services in a way that it is not prohibitive to competition and innovation.

Through the Request for Information (RFI) process The GSA Secure Cloud Portfolio is seeking feedback regarding 
1. **How agency attempts to enforce requirements via contract language:** We hope to [receive examples](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp/blob/master/rfi-directory/contract_language.md) of both positive and problematic clauses so that we may develop better guidance that leads to better outcomes for both government and industry. We’re also looking for new and creative examples of industry suggested contract language that could be leveraged as well.

### Reference
The information gathered here will be used to identify examples of that agencies should and should not use to incorporate FedRAMP standards in their solicitations. These examples will be used to generate guidance and education to agencies. For more information on additional ways FedRAMP has supported agency acquisitions, please see:
